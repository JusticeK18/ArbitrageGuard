ü§ñ ML-Driven Arbitrage Bot Contract
-----------------------------------

This document provides a comprehensive overview and technical specification for the **ArbitrageGuard** smart contract. This contract governs an automated, machine learning-driven arbitrage trading bot, facilitating secure fund management, trade execution, performance tracking, and crucial safety mechanisms on the blockchain.

### üí° Core Functionality

The contract's primary role is to execute arbitrage trades proposed by off-chain ML models. It ensures that trades adhere to predefined risk management policies (e.g., maximum trade size, minimum confidence score, cooldown period) before logging the results and updating performance metrics for the active ML model.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Governance Features

-   **Circuit Breaker:** Automatically pauses all trading activity if cumulative losses exceed a predefined threshold (20% of capital), protecting investor funds.

-   **Trade Cooldown:** Enforces a minimum block delay (10 blocks) between trades to prevent excessive high-frequency trading and potential network congestion.

-   **Confidence Threshold:** Trades must meet a minimum confidence score (70%) from the ML model to be considered for execution.

-   **Max Trade Size:** Limits the capital exposed in any single trade (10% of total funds).

-   **Owner Governance:** Exclusive functions for the contract owner to manage bot operations (pause/resume), authorize trade operators, and update the active ML model version.

-   **Operator Authorization:** Only pre-approved addresses can call the core trade execution function.

üõ†Ô∏è Public Functions (API)
--------------------------

### **`execute-ml-arbitrage-trade`**

Code snippet

```
(define-public (execute-ml-arbitrage-trade
    (trade-amount uint)
    (predicted-profit uint)
    (confidence-score uint)
    (source-exchange (string-ascii 20))
    (target-exchange (string-ascii 20)))
    (response {trade-id: uint, executed: bool, profit: int, circuit-breaker-triggered: bool} (err uint))
)

```

**Description:** The primary function for executing trades. It is called by an authorized operator to submit a trade proposal from the off-chain ML bot. The function performs all necessary checks---authorization, bot status, circuit breaker status, confidence score, trade size, and cooldown---before simulating the trade outcome, updating all statistics, recording the trade, and checking for circuit breaker activation.

**Error Conditions:** `err-unauthorized`, `err-bot-paused`, `err-circuit-breaker-active`, `err-invalid-confidence`, `err-insufficient-funds`, `err-max-trade-exceeded`, `err-cooldown-active`.

### **`deposit-funds`**

Code snippet

```
(define-public (deposit-funds (amount uint)) (response bool (err uint)))

```

**Description:** Allows any user to deposit STX funds into the contract for use in trading. The funds are transferred to the contract's principal and tracked in `user-deposits` and `total-funds`.

### **`withdraw-funds`**

Code snippet

```
(define-public (withdraw-funds (amount uint)) (response bool (err uint)))

```

**Description:** Allows a user to withdraw their deposited STX funds. Asserts that the requested amount does not exceed the user's recorded balance.

**Description:** (Owner Only) Manually sets `bot-active` to `false`, immediately halting all trade execution.

**Error Condition:** `err-owner-only`.

### **`resume-bot`**

Code snippet

```
(define-public (resume-bot) (response bool (err uint)))

```

**Description:** (Owner Only) Sets `bot-active` to `true` and also resets `circuit-breaker-active` to `false`, restoring trading operations.

**Error Condition:** `err-owner-only`.

### **`update-model-version`**

Code snippet

```
(define-public (update-model-version (new-version uint)) (response bool (err uint)))

```

**Description:** (Owner Only) Updates the `current-model-version` variable, ensuring subsequent trades are tracked against the new model ID in `trade-history` and `model-metrics`.

**Error Condition:** `err-owner-only`.

* * * * *

üîí Private Functions (Internal Logic)
-------------------------------------

### **`calculate-percentage`**

Code snippet

```
(define-private (calculate-percentage (value uint) (total uint)) uint)

```

**Description:** Calculates `(value * 100) / total`. Used internally for checking trade size against `max-trade-percentage` and losses against `circuit-breaker-threshold`.

### **`should-trigger-circuit-breaker`**

Code snippet

```
(define-private (should-trigger-circuit-breaker) bool)

```

**Description:** Computes the loss percentage based on `total-loss` and `total-funds`. Returns `true` if this percentage is greater than or equal to `circuit-breaker-threshold` (`u20`).

### **`update-model-metrics`**

Code snippet

```
(define-private (update-model-metrics (model-ver uint) (success bool) (confidence uint) (profit int)) (response bool (err uint)))

```

**Description:** Updates the aggregate performance data for a specific ML model version within the `model-metrics` map. It recalculates the total trade count, successful predictions, average confidence, and total profit/loss for that version.

### **`validate-trade-params`**

Code snippet

```
(define-private (validate-trade-params (amount uint) (confidence uint)) bool)

```

**Description:** A helper function that consolidates all pre-execution checks: `bot-active`, `circuit-breaker-active`, `min-confidence-score`, `max-trade-percentage`, `total-funds` sufficiency, and `trade-cooldown-blocks`. This function, though not used in `execute-ml-arbitrage-trade` in its current form (the checks are inlined), demonstrates a logical grouping of validation rules.
